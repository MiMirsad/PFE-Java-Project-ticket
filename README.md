Train Ticket Reservation Management System

This project is a desktop application developed as part of my final year academic project. It is designed to manage the reservation and administration of train tickets in a centralized and user-friendly environment. The system provides a robust solution for train scheduling, user registration, travel routes, discounts, and ticket generation.

Technologies Used:

Java (Swing) – for developing the graphical user interface (GUI)

Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 19 – for database design and management

JDBC – for connecting Java with the SQL Server database

UML – used for modeling (Use Case and Class diagrams)


Key Features:

Secure user and admin authentication system

Management modules for trains, stations, staff, routes, and members

Ticket booking and printing functionalities

Admin dashboard for full control over the system

Clean, organized UI for efficient user interaction


This project was completed individually under academic supervision, offering a practical solution for modern train ticketing and travel data management.
