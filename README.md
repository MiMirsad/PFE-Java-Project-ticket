# Train Ticket Reservation Management System

This project is a desktop application developed as part of my final year academic project. It is designed to manage the reservation and administration of train tickets in a centralized and user-friendly environment. The system provides a robust solution for train scheduling, user registration, travel routes, discounts, and ticket generation.

## Technologies Used

- *Java (Swing)* – for developing the graphical user interface (GUI)
- *Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 19* – for database design and management
- *JDBC* – for connecting Java with the SQL Server database
- *UML* – used for modeling (Use Case and Class diagrams)

## Key Features

- Secure user and admin authentication system
- Management modules for:
  - Trains
  - Stations
  - Staff
  - Travel routes
  - Members (Adhérents)
  - Discount cards
- Ticket booking and printing functionalities
- Admin dashboard for full control over the system
- Clean, organized UI for efficient user interaction

## About the Project

This project was completed individually as part of my academic training. It reflects real-world use cases for transportation systems, providing both technical experience and practical application in software development.
